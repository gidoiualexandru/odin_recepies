    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition. We frequently double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker. Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day! Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the leftovers.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices day-old white bread, crumbled</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
        <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until light brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a mixing bowl. </li>
        <li>Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with onion in the mixing bowl. Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream. </li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon meat mixture per meatball; form into balls. Place meatballs into the skillet and cook, turning often, until browned, about 5 minutes. Insides of meatballs will still be pink. </li>
    </ol>
